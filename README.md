# ibf-cron-messages

## Synopsis

A plugin for [irc-bot-framework](https://github.com/jthomerson/irc-bot-framework) that makes it easy to
schedule messages to be sent via cron scheduling.

Why would you need this?

   1. You want a reminder every day at a certain time to do something ... send yourself a message.
   2. You have other plugins that you want to run on a particular schedule. Just send them a command via cron as if an actual user commanded them.
